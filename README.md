Read Me (Or don't)


Hello everybody my name is <b>Kyra Hernandez</b>. 
<br></brI>
<br></brI>
I learned HTML when I was about 12 years old so all I remember is <b>how to bold things</b> and how to <i>italize them*.</i> 



<b>About Me</b>

 - I'm from Austin, Texas. 
 - 19 years old
 - I'm transferring next year so there's no point in talking about my major
 - I have two jobs here at TNS, so say hi if you're ever in the neighborhood of the History department or the Learning Center
 
 <br>
 </br>
 
 <c>Math kind of makes me want to cry but I'm working on it.</c>








<br>
<U>*Oh HELL yeah I forgot about underlining.</U>
